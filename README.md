# Building Energy Benchmarking Project

## Data

- **Dataset**: '2016 Building Energy Benchmarking'
- **Source**: Collected by the city of Seattle
- **Link**: [Seattle Data Portal](https://data.seattle.gov/Permitting/2016-Building-Energy-Benchmarking/2bpz-gwpy/about_data)

## Project Goal

The aim of this project is to predict:
1. **Energy Use** of a building
2. **Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHG)**

## Notebooks

1. **1_Cleaning**:
   - Tasks: Data cleaning and analysis

2. **2_Modeling_EnergyUse**:
   - Tasks: Testing various models to predict **Energy Use**

3. **3_Modeling_GHG**:
   - Tasks: Testing various models to predict **GHG Emissions**

4. **4_Modeling_GHG_with_EnergyScore**:
   - Tasks: Testing different approaches to predict **GHG Emissions**, incorporating the **EnergyStarScore** feature.

**Note**: The best predictions are found in Notebook 4.
